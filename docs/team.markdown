**[Dr. Stan Hok-Wui Wong](https://stanhwwong.github.io/stanhwwong/)** has written extensively on Hong Kong politics and society. His previous works touch on issues such as electoral politics and state-business relations. In particular, his book, entitled *Electoral Politics in Post-1997 Hong Kong: Protest, Patronage, and the Media*, provides a parsimonious explanation for the waning electoral performance of the prodemocracy opposition parties, despite the public’s unwavering support for democratization. He is also a member of the research teams for the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS) and the World Values Survey (WVS) in Hong Kong. His works have been published or accepted in journals such as the *British Journal of Political Science*, *China Quarterly*, *Electoral Studies*, *Journal of Peace Research*, and *Political Behavior*.

The unifying theme of my research is to use data science methods to explain and prescribe social and political problems.
